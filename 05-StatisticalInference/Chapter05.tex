{Statistical Inference}
{Introduction}
Definitions such as point estimators and statistical intervals belong to a branch of statistical theory known as \textit{descriptive statistics}, that is, methods that are focused on accurately describing characteristics such as location or uncertainty about a given population parameter;
\vone
While these concepts are certainly important, in many cases description is not enough -- one may need decision-making tools to deal with information from random samples, tools that allow a researcher to perform \textit{inference} with a quantifiable degree of certainty.

	{Comparing Competing Hypotheses}
	As multiple, competing hypotheses can be proposed to explain any given phenomenon, it is common to contrast these proposed explanations using a number of criteria. 
	\vone
	Besides the required testability / falsifiability and the desired parsimony, common ones include:
	\vone
	\bitems Scope: how applicable is the hypothesis to multiple instances of the phenomenon it addresses?
	\item External consistency: how well does the hypothesis fit with existing, well-accepted knowledge systems?
	\eitem

{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Definitions}
\textit{Statistical hypotheses} are defined as objective statements about parameters of one or more populations;
\vone
\textbf{Attention}: the statements in statistical hypotheses are about parameters of the \textit{population} or \textit{model}, \textbf{not the \textit{sample}}.
\vone
the \textit{null hypothesis significance testing} (NHST) approach involves the contrast between \textit{null} and \textit{alternative} hypotheses.

{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Example}
Suppose you own a company that sells green peas to large customers, 
and that you want to determine whether your $50$kg sacks really 
contain their nominal weight (at least on average).
\vhalf
In this case the null hypothesis could be defined as:
\textit{the average net weight of a sack is $50$kg}, and the alternative of interest could be expressed as the complementary inequality.
\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu = 50kg \\
H_1: \mu \neq 50kg 
\end{cases}\eqs
\vone
Suppose still that $n = 10$ sacks are randomly sampled, and their contents are weighted using a reliable scale;

	\spitem The sacks sampled are representative of our population of interest (i.e., of the sacks that are actually going to be sold);
	\spitem The contents of the sacks are only green peas (no significant amounts of stones or other contaminants);

\begin{ftst}
{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Example}
Since the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is a good estimator of the real mean $\mu$, common sense suggests that:

\bitems If $\bar{x} \cong 50$kg - corroboration of $H_0$;
\item If $\bar{x} \ll 50$kg or $\bar{x} \gg 50$kg - refutation of $H_0$;
\eitem
\vone
That is, we can use $\bar{x}$ as the basis for a test. But how to define a \textit{critical region} for the rejection of $H_0$?

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type I error}
\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
\textbf{Type I error} (false positive): rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
\end{colorblock}
\vone
The probability of occurrence of a false positive in any hypothesis testing procedure is generally known as the \textit{significance level} of the test, represented by Greek letter $\alpha$:
\beqs \alpha = P\left(\mbox{type I error}\right) = P\left(\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\mbox{ is true}\right)\eqs
\vone
Another frequently used term is the \textit{confidence level} of the test, given by $(1-\alpha)$ or, sometimes, as $100(1-\alpha)\%$.
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type I error}
For a given sample, the selected value of $\alpha$ defines the critical threshold for the rejection of $H_0$.
\vone
If $H_0$ is true (i.e., if $\mu=50$kg), the distribution of values of $\bar{x}$ is approximately normal (assuming the CLT conditions are met), with average $50$kg and standard error $(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ kg;
\vone
For a desired Type-I error probability $\alpha=0.05$, the critical values of the distribution of $\bar{x}$ are the ones for which the probability content within the acceptance region under the null hypothesis is $1-\alpha = 0.95$.

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
\textbf{Type II error} (false negative): failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
\end{colorblock}
\vone
The probability of occurrence of a false negative in any hypothesis testing procedure is generally represented by the Greek letter $\beta$:

\beqs 
\beta = P\left(\mbox{type II error}\right) = P\left(\mbox{not reject }H_0|H_0\mbox{ is false}\right)
\eqs

The quantity ($1-\beta$) is known as \textit{power} of the test, and quantifies its sensitivity to effects that violate the null hypothesis.

{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
\begin{columns}[T]
	\column{0.55\textwidth}
		Unlike the Type-I error, the definition of the Type-II error rate requires further specification of the value of the parameter being investigated under the alternative hypothesis;
		\vone
		The probability of failing to reject a false $H_0$ is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the difference between the value under $H_0$ and the real value of the parameter.

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
The power of a test is governed by several factors:

\bitems Controllable: significance level, sample size, directionality of $H_1$;
	\item Uncontrollable: real value of the parameter, variance;
\eitem

If $H_0$ is false, the smaller the magnitude of the difference between the real value of the parameter and the one under the null hypothesis, the greater the probability of a type II error - \textbf{\textit{but the practical importance of the effect gets smaller}}.
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Considerations}
\textbf{Type I error} ($\alpha$) depends only on the distribution of the null hypothesis - easier to control;
\vone
\textbf{Type II error} ($\beta$) depends on the real value of the parameter - more difficult to specify and control;
\vone
These characteristics lead to the following classification of the conclusions obtained from the test of hypotheses:
\begin{block}{}
\bitems Rejection of $H_0$ - \textit{strong} conclusion; 
\spitem Failure to reject $H_0$ - \textit{weak} conclusion (but we can strengthen it);
\eitem
\end{block}
\vone
It is important to remember that failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean that there is evidence in favor of $H_0$ - it only suggests that it is a better model than the alternative.

{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Back to the green peas example, we want to determine if there is any significant deviation on the mean weight of the sacks. Assume (for now) that the variance of the process is known. The test hypotheses are defined as:

\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu = 50kg\\
H_1: \mu \neq 50kg
\end{cases}\eqs
\vone
Let the desired significance level be $\alpha = 0.05$;
\vone
Given these characteristics, we expect that the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ is normal, with $Var(\bar{X})=\sigma^2/n$ and, \underline{\textbf{if $H_0$ is true}}, a mean of $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\mu_0=50$;
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[anchor=north east,yshift=12pt,xshift=-5pt] at (current page.north east) {\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{../figs/peas.png}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Based on these characteristics, the standardized variable
\beqs Z_0 = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\eqs
\vhalf
\noindent will be distributed, \underline{\textbf{under the null hypothesis}}, according to the standard normal, $\mathcal{N}\left(0,1\right)$.
\vhalf
This result implies that:
\beqs
P\left(z_{\alpha/2}\leq Z_0\leq z_{1-\alpha/2}\mid H_0~\mbox{is true}\right) = 1-\alpha
\eqs

\noindent which provides a selection criterion between $H_0$ and $H_1$:
\vhalf
\bitems If $z_{\alpha/2}> Z_0$ or $z_{1-\alpha/2}<Z_0$, reject $H_0$ with confidence $(1-\alpha)$;
	\spitem Otherwise, there is not enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at this confidence level;
\eitem
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]

\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Assume that we got $\bar{x} = 49.65$kg from our $n=10$ observations, and that we know that $\sigma = 1$kg. In this case,

\beqs 
z_0 = \frac{49.65 - 50}{1/\sqrt{10}} = -1.113
\eqs
\vhalf
The critical values of the standard normal distribution at the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$ are $\left[z_{0.025},z_{0.975}\right] = \left[-1.96,1.96\right]$;
\vone
Since $z_0\in \left[-1.96,1.96\right]$, we can conclude that there is not enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the $95\%$ confidence level.
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance unknown}
Suppose now a more realistic situation in which the real variance is unknown. Besides, assume that we are interested in detecting only negative deviations from the nominal contents of the package.
\vone
The test hypotheses can be defined as:
\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu \geq 50kg\\
H_1: \mu < 50kg 
\end{cases}\eqs
\vhalf
Assume also that we want to be more conservative, so we pick a significance level $\alpha = 0.01$;
\vone
In this case, \textbf{if $H_0$ is true}, we have that
\beqs T_0 = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
\eqs
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance unknown}
From the same data used earlier, $\bar{x} = 49.65$kg, $n=10$, $s = 0.697$kg:
\beqs t_0 = \frac{49.65 - 50}{0.697/\sqrt{10}} = -1.597\eqs
\vhalf
The critical value of this test statistic for the desired significance is $t_{\alpha,n-1} = t_{0.01,9} = -2.82$, which means that under $H_0$ there is a $99\%$ change that the test statistic will yield a value greater than this number.
\vone
Given that $t_0 > -2.82$, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to reject $H_0$ at the $99\%$ confidence level;

{p-values, significance and effect sizes}
To ``tell the whole story'' of the experiment, it is necessary to use \textbf{effect size estimators} alongside the tests of statistical significance; 
\vone
While there are whole books on the subject\footnote[3]{\tiny See, for instance, Paul D. Ellis' \textit{The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes}, Cambridge University Press, 2010.}, the main idea is quite simple - to quantify the magnitude of the observed deviation from the null hypothesis.
\vone
Examples of effect size estimators include the simple point estimator for the difference $\bar{x} - \mu_0$, or the dimensionless \textit{d} estimator:

\beqs
d = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s}
\eqs

\noindent which quantifies the difference in terms of sample standard deviations.

Once $\delta^*$ is defined, the experimenter can obtain an estimate of the variability of observations (e.g., by a pilot study), which can then be used to obtain an approximate power value for the experiment;

{Sample size and Type-II error}
{Some considerations}
Having obtained this estimation of the Type-II error probability, one can run his/her experiment with a better understanding of its ability to detect effects of interest.
\vone
The test will have lower power for differences smaller than $\delta^*$, but these differences are below the minimally interesting effect; any effect greater than $\delta^*$ will result in a higher power for the test;
\vone
This technique is most useful to compute the required sample size for the experiment.

\begin{ftstf}
{Sample size and Type-II error}
{Example}
Suppose that on the green peas example we are really interested in detecting negative deviations from the nominal value greater than $1\%$, i.e., $\delta^* = 0.01\times 50 = 0.5$kg. The researcher defines that, for this minimally interesting effect, a test power of $0.85$ is desired. The desired significance is $\alpha = 0.01$.
\vone
The same sample of $n=10$ sacks is used. Assume that a reasonable upper bound for the standard deviation can be estimated as $\sigma=1$kg. From this data, we can compute the power of this test as:
\begin{columns}
\column[T]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{rcode}
> s <- sd(sample)
> power.t.test(n = 10, 
+        delta = 0.5,

+        sig.level = 0.01, 
+        type = "one.sample", 
+        alternative = "one.sided")

We need at least 48 observations to detect a $-0.5kg\ (1\%)$ or larger deviation on the mean weight of the green peas packages with a power level of $0.85$.

{The normality assumption}
The assumption of normality, required for the \textbf{z} and \textbf{t} tests, needs to be validated.
	\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
	``\textit{The Assumption of Normality (note the upper case) that underlies parametric stats does not assert that the observations within a given sample are normally distributed, nor does it assert that the values within the population (from which the sample was taken) are normal. This core element of the Assumption of Normality asserts that \textbf{the distribution of sample means (across independent samples) is normal.}}''\\

Analytical tests of normality (choose \textbf{one});
\bitems Shapiro-Wilk;
	\item Anderson-Darling;
	\item Lilliefors / Kolmogorov-Smirnov;
\eitem
\vone
These procedures use different aspects of the sample distribution to test the following hypotheses:
\beqs\begin{cases}
	H_0: \mbox{population is normal}\\
	H_1: \mbox{population is not normal}
\end{cases}\eqs
\vhalf
In this case, rejection of the null hypothesis suggests evidence that the \textbf{sample} came from a non-normal population. Generally we use a strict $\alpha$ threshold for these tests, and consider their results together with a graphical analysis.

{The normality assumption}
Even thought the Lilliefors / Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is possibly the most widely used for normality testing, the Shapiro-Wilk test is recommended as a better alternative in Michael Crawley's \textit{The R Book}, and will be used throughout this course.

{The independence assumption}
Possibly the strongest assumption of the statistical model used for the t-test is that of independence, that is, of the absence of unmodeled biases contaminating the data.
\vhalf
While I know of no procedure to test independence in the general case, the special case of serial autocorrelations in the data (which can emerge, for instance, as a consequence of heating effects or equipment degradation) can be tested by a procedure known as the Durbin-Watson test:
\begin{rcode}
> library(car)
> durbinWatsonTest(lm(sample ~ 1))

lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value
1      -0.0848535      2.111733   0.898
Alternative hypothesis: rho != 0

\node[anchor=north east,yshift=12pt,xshift=-5pt] at (current page.north east) {\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{../figs/peas.png}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{ftstf}

%=====

\begin{ftstf}
{Model validation}
{The independence assumption}
The Durbin-Watson test depends on the ordering of the data, so observations should be ordered (either in the data file or by manipulating the data vector) according to covariates that are suspected to introduce dependencies, e.g., order of collection, placement criteria, etc.
\vone
Violations of the independence assumption tend to be the hardest to weed out, so extra care is recommended in the design of the experiment in order to prevent, control, or at least document all variables that could introduce dependencies in the data.

{Going over the process}
After examining the green peas example, it is interesting to go back and follow the recommended sequence for this kind of experiment:

\bitems Formulate question of interest;
	\spitem Define minimally interesting effect;
	\spitem Define desired confidence and power;
	\spitem Calculate required sample size;
	\spitem Collect data;
	\spitem Perform statistical analysis;
	\spitem Draw conclusions and recommendations.
