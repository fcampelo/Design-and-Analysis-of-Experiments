## Lecture Notes on Design and Analysis of Experiments  
### **Prof. Felipe Campelo, Ph.D.**  

Here are my Lecture Notes on Design & Analysis of Experiments, originally developed for the course I offer twice a year in [UFMG](http://www.ufmg.br)'s [Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering](http://ppgee.ufmg.br/index.php). I hope they might prove useful elsewhere.

I am releasing these lecture notes under a [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, which I believe is pretty open. If you want to use or modify this material, please do me a favor and cite the original source. I would also greatly appreciate if you let me know that you're using it - I take a small pride on these things. ;-)  

As far as I am aware, these notes are also being used (in full, in part, or adapted) by:

- [Prof. Claus Aranha, Tsukuba University, Japan](https://github.com/caranha/ExperimentDesignLectureNotes)
- [Prof. Vicente Machado Neto, Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Brazil](http://www.energiapura.net.br/alunos/planejamento_experimentos/Aulas_PAE/)
- [Prof. Elizabeth F. Wanner, CEFET-MG, Brazil](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2243256075052322)

The lectures are fully developed in Beamer, with R as the statistical software of choice. All example files and datasets will also be made available here.
